# Gravity

GRAVITY is a resilient, distributed smart contracts computational network that allows multiple independent ledgers with tunable replication and performance parameters, while maintaining easy interoperability among constellations of autonomous agents. In addition to a verifiable self-executing substrate, the Space platform relies heavily on Gravity’s features to enable its economic ecosystem. One of Gravity’s most distinguishing features is logical decentralization while allowing network wide transaction consistency, allowing the following properties:
- Autonomy: In Gravity, the Virtual Machines that execute the contract code are autonomous and self-governed while retaining interoperability.
- Privacy: VMs may have a private state and engage in private contracts, where only the parties to the contract have access rights to the shared state.
- Scalability: Networks of interoperable logical distinct VMs inherit the natural scalability properties of networks.
- Speed: Since there is no one single global state to replicate and agree upon, consistent, high speed commits, among autonomous VMs/Agents may be achieved through distributed transactions.
